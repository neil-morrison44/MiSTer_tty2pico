# Image Credits

These images found were sourced on the internet, we take no credit for creating (most of) them, but have altered quite a few to fit the screens tty2pico is tested on. They are here strictly for testing performance of the display code.

All variants of the MiSTer logos and MiSTer Kun character were sourced from the [MiSTer Kun repository](https://github.com/baxysquare/mister_kun).
